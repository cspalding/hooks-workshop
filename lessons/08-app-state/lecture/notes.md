In old React when we needed state we needed to refactor function components into classes to use various lifecycle hooks. Now with hooks we can use state within a function component!

We used to use Redux to manage state with reducers and dispatchers, but now React has those built in! Basically this lecture talks about why we don't need redux anymore in stateful React apps.
